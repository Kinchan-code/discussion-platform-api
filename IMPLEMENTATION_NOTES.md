# Implementation Notes: Community-Powered Protocol & Discussion Platform API

## Overview

This project delivers a robust Laravel 12 REST API for a wellness-focused, community-driven platform. It supports protocols, threads, comments, reviews, and voting, with advanced search and filtering via Typesense Cloud. The codebase is architected for maintainability, scalability, and industry-standard quality.

## Key Features

-   Full CRUD for protocols, threads, comments, reviews, and votes
-   Polymorphic voting system (threads, comments, reviews)
-   User profiles and statistics (activity, analytics)
-   Service layer pattern and DTO-based data transformation
-   Typesense-powered full-text search and advanced filtering
-   Token-based authentication (Laravel Sanctum)
-   Exception handling and security best practices throughout
-   Realistic database seeding and factories
-   Unified API responses and comprehensive validation

## Architecture

-   **Service Layer**: All business logic is encapsulated in service classes, keeping controllers thin and maintainable.
-   **DTOs**: Consistent data transformation for all API responses.
-   **SOLID Principles**: Single responsibility, dependency injection, and modularity throughout.
-   **RESTful Design**: Resource controllers, proper HTTP status codes, and request validation.
-   **Database Modeling**: Proper relationships, foreign keys, indexing, and migrations.
-   **Typesense Integration**: Real-time and manual indexing for protocols and threads.
